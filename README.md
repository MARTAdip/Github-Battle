# Welcome to Github Battle!



The idea is to have different UIs, based on the most popular **Repos**, and sorted by languages. And then a **Battle** between profiles, in which the user will type tow different **Github profiles** , and based on the count of how many repos, how many followers and followings, and stars a profile has, we will see who's the winner :)))

This is a small frontend application, using React and the boilerplate made from scratch, no create-react-app is being used. 
Deployed using netlify.
